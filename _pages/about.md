Welcome! I am a Master Student in the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://insaat.ege.edu.tr/) at
[University in Ä°zmir](https://ege.edu.tr/tr-0/anasayfa.html). I am also an
Computer Vision Engineer at
[Syntonym](https://syntonym.com/).

I have been working on data anonymization since 2019. My field of work is the development and deployment of detection, tracking, classification and generative algorithms. I mainly work on model and pipeline optimization in deployment processes. I have experienced the optimization of models and their implementation on different devices with tensorrt, onnx and ncnn frameworks. I also worked on mobile ai deployment processes. I worked on model compression in model development processes.
