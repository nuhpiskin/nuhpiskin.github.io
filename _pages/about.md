Welcome! I am a Master Student in the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://insaat.ege.edu.tr/) at
[University in Ä°zmir](https://ege.edu.tr/tr-0/anasayfa.html). I am also an
Computer Vision Engineer at
[Syntonym](https://syntonym.com/).

My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. My [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
