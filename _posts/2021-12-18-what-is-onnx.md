Open Neural Network Exchange(ONNX) is  a machine learning framework translation agent. This agent is used to convert different machine learning models to each other. Let's say you want to switch from pytorch to tensorflow or tensorrt and use your model with that framework. ONNX is a good agent to convert models. Because ONNX supports many frameworks. You can reach the supported frameworks from the [link](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools.html). There are multiple ways of model translation. But what makes ONNX important is that it supports more frameworks and supports many operators in frameworks. You can reach the supported operators from the [link](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md).
